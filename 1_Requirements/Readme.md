School management is a very common task for any School which has a number of employees and student. Though the method differ from organization to organization. The school management system of the earlier times had a manual system using ledger books to keep track of every single employee’s salary and student fees history, calculate. This pen and paper based system is much time consuming and there is a great chance to make mistake as there are very good number of employees and student in this organization and keeping patience is a tough job to manipulate so many things. Unauthorized persons however, easily accessed the paper system and hence making it impossible to keep secrecy and confidentiality. So such a system is time consuming, prone to errors of entry and analysis resulting from the fatigue of the users.
Now if we view the system from the other employees’ and student (who are the end user of the system) point of view, then the system is also monotonous. Because if one employee/student wants to check his/her statistics of the salary/fees record then it is very difficult to get it without any help of automated system.
So, it is obvious to migrate the whole process in an automated way so that which help the authority and user to maintain all the things with ease.
